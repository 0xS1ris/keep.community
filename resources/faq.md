## Keep

### **What is Keep?**

Keep could refer to different things:

* the Keep network which is the network behind the keep project \(see [Keep Network](https://www.notion.so/Keep-Network-bf10fdee0e7f4b2b9c56edcfa9be026b)\)
* the KEEP token which is the working token at the heart of the network \(see [Keep Token](https://www.notion.so/Keep-Token-cf43ab0d082e4e71ac3b307d94031fca)\)
* a keep which is small off-chain container to store private data \(see the whitepaper in [Keep Network](https://www.notion.so/Keep-Network-bf10fdee0e7f4b2b9c56edcfa9be026b)\).

### **Where can I buy/sell KEEP?**

Buy/sell KEEP on DEXes or CEXes \(ðŸ’©\) exchanges. I ain't no snitch, but if you're looking for names, see the list of exchanges on [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/keep-network).

### **What is the KEEP total supply?**

The total supply is 1,000,000,000 tokens. See [Token Liquidity](https://www.notion.so/Token-Liquidity-e120e6386a5e498ca96a118cde8bdc3e)

### Was there an ICO for KEEP?

KEEP has not been introduced through an ICO. Please see [Distribution & Supply](../keep-token/token-liquidity.md) to get more info.

### At what price the first investors bought KEEP for?

 According to [Messari](https://messari.io/asset/keep-network/profile), Industrial Staker Sale \(Series A Tranche\) in 2017: $0.0720 per KEEP and Staker Sale \(Series B Tranche\) in 2019: $0.120 per KEEP.

## tBTC

### **What is tBTC?**

tBTC is a tokenised BTC to bring BTC in the Etherum space. Check [tBTC](https://www.notion.so/tBTC-2bcc050e2ffe42849b29e20e0a3e97a8).

### **tBTC vs TBTC? Why do you** _**keep**_ **changing the spelling?**

The system, in its entirety, is called "tBTC". The fungible Bitcoin-backed token is called "TBTC" to distinguish it from the rest of the project. This approach is also reflected in the Ethereum ERC-20 token contract. Further discussion can be found in the relevant [Github issue](https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc/issues/17).

### Is there a minimum to swap BTC to TBTC?

0.001 BTC, see tBTC [lot sizes](https://keep.community/tbtc/features#lot-sizes).

## Earn

### **How can I earn KEEP?**

You can earn KEEP by creating and maintaining a node \(Random Beacon and/or ECDSA\). More information in the [Staking](https://www.notion.so/Staking-e1c2a3b96d3e427d994902efad077802) section.

### **How much KEEP can I earn?**

You earn KEEP through fees and 200,000,000 KEEPs \(20% of the token supply\) will be distributed through the stakedrop. How much you will earn will depend on the amount of KEEP and/or ETH you stake and how much other people will stake. More information in [Stakedrop](https://www.notion.so/Stakedrop-6ced0ccedc3748e789d179a59a87f207).

### **What is the KEEP distribution schedule?**

Have a look to the reward model in [Stakedrop](https://www.notion.so/Stakedrop-6ced0ccedc3748e789d179a59a87f207).

### **How long do I have to stake my ETH?**

You have to stake your ETH for the length of at least one tBTC deposit. That could be as short as a week or as long as 6 months.

### What is the ratio of the locked ETH and $KEEP a user will get?

Depends on how much ETH has been staked across the system. If you're the only one, you get most of the KEEP per reward period.

### How often and where would I receive my part of the stakedrop?

Monthly in the beneficiary address. 

## Nodes

### **How can I run a node?**

Have a look to [Contract addresses](../keep-network/contract-addresses.md) where you can fin all [mainnet contract addresses](https://gist.github.com/knarz/034654b56096f99aa857bdaebe6c8710) and all [testnet contract addresses](https://gist.github.com/knarz/b3b906bf8b3f7255b5dc90f96d1c0165).

### What is the minimum amount of KEEP to stake?

Over 2 years, the minimum amount to stake is lowered periodically using a uniform stepwise function, starting at 100k KEEP and eventually ending at 10k KEEP. See [How do we stake?](../staking/presentation.md#minimum-of-keep-to-stake) for the detailed schedule.
