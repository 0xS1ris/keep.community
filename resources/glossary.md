# Glossary

### **ECDSA**

The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm \(ECDSA\) is a cryptographic signature. ECDSA offers a variant of the Digital Signature Algorithm \(DSA\) which uses elliptic curve cryptography.

### **KEEP**

This is the native token that powers the network and supports all the apps that are built on it. The token is used for staking to run a node.

### **keep**

A keep is a small off-chain container that stores private data.

### **Play for Keeps \(PFK\)**

Reward program for contributing to the community \(see [**Play for Keeps**](https://www.notion.so/Play-for-Keeps-acfbee14d60f4802847928ff64c3a2dd)\).

### **Random Beacon**

Random Beacons are at the heart of the network. They randomly select providers to create a new keep.

### **Ropsten**

Etherum testnet selected by the Keep team.

### **Slashing**

A slash is a penalty for signing group misbehavior. It results in the removal of a portion of your delegated KEEP tokens \(usually one minimum stake\)

### **sMPC**

Secure Multi-Party Computation is a protocol where multiple computers need to complete a secure handshake to access secret data \(see [Keep Network](https://www.notion.so/Keep-Network-bf10fdee0e7f4b2b9c56edcfa9be026b)\).

### **Staking**

An amount of KEEP that is bonded in order to run a node and participate the Keep network to earn some fees.

### **Staking provider**

Dedicated organisations which run various token nodes. You can delegate them your KEEP to earn fees \(see [Staking providers](https://www.notion.so/Staking-providers-12da01c9b1ea41929711894cbbe9fa20)\).

### **Stakedrop**

Defined amount of time during which KEEP tokens are distributed for maintaining a node in the network \(ECDSA or Random Beacon\).

### **tBTC**

The first application built on the Keep Network. This is a tokenised BTC to allow BTC holders to access the Etherum space.

### **TBTC**

An ERC-20 token that acts as a bridge between the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains.

### **Token liquidity**

Amount of tokens available to be bought or sold.
