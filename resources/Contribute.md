If you think that this collection of links and knowledge could be improved (we definitely think it could), send a Pull Request on Github.

## Repository

If you're familiar with Github, and you know your way around, here's the repo. Fork away and shoot your PRs:

[0xS1ris/keep.community](https://github.com/0xS1ris/keep.community)

## Interacting with Github

There are three ways of doing this:

- [Github Web App](https://github.com/) (directly from the web)
- [Github Desktop App](https://desktop.github.com/) (it lets you fork projects on your hard drive and interact with files locally)
- command line (if you can use this, you don't need any tutorial).

## Tutorials

### Pull Requests in Github (fork first)

## Link Temp Folder on Discord

We also thought about creating a channel on Discord (#keep-community-contribute) where we pick up the links and publish them ourselves. To be discussed with Matt + team.
