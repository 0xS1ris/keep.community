# 🧐 About keep.community

## Once upon a time...

Some time ago, we started investigating and reading about KEEP. After throwing back and forth a bunch of links and interesting articles, it came to us:

> 🤬Why is there no centralized place where all these links live?

Since we're product managers with an obsession for documenting, we thought that it would be helpful to have a central place for all this \(somewhat\) organized information.

It's not an easy task. Based on the knowledge and background of each reader, there are different ways that information could be structured, and the amount of explanation needed for each section. We believe that it's a work-in-progress, and we will continue to update it, as long as our agendas, bosses, and personal lives allow for it.

## **🚚 Happy to move this space somewhere else!**

If the community feels that it's better to have this in some other space \(Keep github?\), let us know! We will gladly move it so we can all contribute together.

## **🗣We love feedback!**

Feel that there's something missing, or some correction you would like to add, or anything else.

## **🔗 What's next?!**

Well, glad you ask. We would **love** to have a **node in production**. We feel that that's the best way of contributing to and believing in the project. However, we do not have all the required funds. So we would be using any grant provided to stake in the node \(as well as make tutorials, and help more people to get onboard\). That's why we're submitting this to **Play for Keeps**. Fingers crossed.
