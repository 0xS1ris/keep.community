# ECDSA

{% hint style="info" %}
ECDSA nodes are needed to run applications on the KEEP network. In cryptography, the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm \(ECDSA\) offers a variant of the Digital Signature Algorithm \(DSA\) which uses elliptic curve cryptography.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You can stake only ETH \(in the first months\) or both ETH and KEEP to run an ECDSA node.
{% endhint %}

## Deployment

### Run an ECDSA node \(Stakedrop launch event\)

The Keep stakedrop kicked off with a live Crowdcast on June 8 2020. This presentation was driven by Matt Luongo \(Keep CEO\) and Sloan Thompson \(devops at Keep\). You can rewatch the video below and learn how to stake.

### Cloud deployment - Google cloud

In this step-by-step tutorial you can learn how to launch both nodes \(BEACON and ECSDA\) on one vps in Google cloud. Steps:

* create a VPS on Google cloud
* create an ether wallet
* get faucet ETH and test KEEP
* create Infura account
* create config files
* deploy on Google using docker

### Helm Charts

"These charts provide a simple way to deploy KEEP Network clients into Kubernetes and make for easier and simplier upgrade processes". Look at the keep-ecdsa for tBTC or other applications.
