# Stakedrop

{% hint style="info" %}
To participate in the stakedrop you must run and maintain at least one node:

* the Random Beacon node by staking KEEP
* the ECDSA node by staking both KEEP and ETH or ETH only.

200,000,000 KEEPs \(20% of the KEEP supply\) are distributed through the stakedrop with 10% \(20 million\) KEEP for Random Beacon and 90% \(180 million\) for ECDSA nodes.
{% endhint %}

## Reward model

Have you wondered how much KEEP you could earn by staking your KEEP and/or ETH? How much could you earn by providing KEEP liquidity? This model is for you to learn:

* how many KEEP will be distributed each month in the stakedrop
* how many KEEP will be distributed each month in the liquidity reward distribution
* how much $ you can make by playing with ETH and KEEP prices in the spreadsheet.
