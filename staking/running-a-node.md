## KEEP backups

### Explanation

This article explains how to backup data in your nodes.  
"If you're running the ECDSA node, you're not just storing data, you're storing 1/3 of a multi-sig key used to sign BTC transactions. If your system is not up/available/responsive during a request for BTC \(redemption of tBTC\), you WILL BE AT RISK for liquidation and lose the ETH staked to that bond."
