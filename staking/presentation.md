# How do we stake?

{% hint style="info" %}
Having a large and diverse number of providers is very important for the networkâ€™s integrity.

To maintain the network, the providers will receive a fee on each transaction but also earn rewards in the first months of the project via the stakedrop program. To become a provider, users can:

* stake KEEP to run a random beacon node
* stake KEEP and ETH or ETH only \(in the first months of the project\) to create a keep following a client request.
{% endhint %}

## Staking Documentation

This is a really clean and well documented wiki about staking and its associated risks. Check it out!

## Minimum of KEEP to stake

Unless you chose to stake only ETH in an ECDSA node, you will need to stake KEEP. Over 2 years, the minimum amount to stake is lowered periodically using a uniform stepwise function, eventually ending at 10,000 KEEP.
